	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a measure of the efficient of time an 
		algorithm takes to complete as a function of the size 
		of its input. It is commonly expressed using big O notation,
		which describes an upper bound on the growth rate of the 
		algorithm's running time.</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b> is a measure of the amount of memory space
		that an algorithm or a program consumes as a function of 
		the size of its input. It represents how the space requireme
		nts of an algorithm grow as the input size increases.

Space complexity is often expressed using big O notation -> O(n)</p>
